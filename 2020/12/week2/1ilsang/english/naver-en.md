- (Eddy is getting ready to go to work.)Come on! Oh, no! The drains are clogged up. Whew... I think I need to call a plumber later.
- (Min calls Eddy.)Good morning, Eddy. Are you on your way to work?
- I was about to leave home. It's such a hectic Monday morning.
- Take it easy, Eddy. Things happen. You'll be fine. Do you want to have lunch with me?

- (in front of a crosswalk)Why won't the light change? Let's just cross the street.
- Come on, Eddy. It's dangerous to jaywalk. Wait! What happened to your head?
- I bumped my head on the corner of a table.
- Oh, no... That must hurt a lot.
- Well, the pain is bearable.

- (Eddy told Min what happened this morning.) So did you call a plumber?
- Not yet. I will. I'm lost when it comes to plumbing. Maybe I should watch how-to videos online.
- Do you want me to look for someone who can fix the problem?
- Yes, please. I'd appreciate that.
- Okay. I'll text you later.
- Thanks. Have a good rest of the day, Min.

- How was your trip?
- Good. The trip was fun. But I've been unlucky lately.
- Why? What happened during the trip?
- Losing a suitcase at the airport was the beginning.
- Oh no! I heard that losing suitcases happens a lot.
- Exactly. But I didn't expect it to happen to me.
- What happened after you got back?
- After my trip, I fell down the stairs and hurt my leg.
- Things haven't really worked out for you lately.

- Can we go over to your house?
- Sure, my mom just made some oatmeal cookies.
- Oh! Your mother's oatmeal cookies are the best! I've tried them, so I know.
- Yeah. Hurry up and get some cookies. But are you coming alone?
- No, I'm on my way with Mike and Charles right now.
- It's been a long time since I've seen the two of them.
- Everyone wants to see you. We've got 15 minutes before we arrive.
- I have to go to the supermarket right now.
- If you arrive first, make yourself at home!

- You seemed to be having a hard time during class today.
- Yes. I was so sleepy that I couldn't keep my head up.
- I couldn't sleep a wink last night because I was tossing and turning.
- That's why you came in a hurry this morning.
- That's right. I was almost late.
- Did you sleep with your phone turned off last night?
- Well, I don't think so, but I noticed it was turned off this morning.
- It's great to wake up without an alarm.
- Yea, it's like a miracle.
