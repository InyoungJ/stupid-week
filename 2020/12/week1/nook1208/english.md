I'd love to ask you in, but my sister's visiting me and i think she's asleep on the couch.

Your sister? Your sister's asleep on the couch? I saw you with her on the subway, now she's asleep on the couch!

Oh i thought i heard you.

Oh that's great you're up.
Rachel this is my sister krista, krista this is rachel.

Hi

Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, i'd fix my self up.

Like it would help.

You're so bad!

You are.

You are so dead. Gonna get you~

I'm very nice to meet you.

Hey can i ask you guys something?

Sure

I don't have any brothers, so i don't know.. but did you guys wrestle?

Oh yeah.

All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.

You weighted 200 pound.

Still, i was quick as a cat.

I met Danny's sister and that was actually the girl on the subway.

Oh you're kidding.

Yeah but they were really.. you know, wrestly.
But i guess that's normal?

We don't wrestle now

Oh yeah since i got too strong for you.

Too strong for me?

Yeah

We finally get to the top of the mountain but airhead here forgets the camera!

Oh the same thing happened to me one time.

When did that happen to you?

Don't you remember? When we were jogging in the park and i found the pretty bird and i wanted take a picture but i didn't have my camera!

I can't believe they're brother and sister.

They're brother and sister?

Oh hey rache, i thought we said seven.

Oh you know what? Let's skip it.

What? Why?

You and your sister seem to have a very special bond.

Oh that's special bond again. Why do the women have a such a problem with the fact that i'm close with my sister?

Hey listen, i don't know what's going on here but,

Do you have brothers?

No, i have two sister, but one of them actually has a very muscline energy.

Well.. i don't know. when you put it that way, 

Danny hurry up. The bath's getting cold
