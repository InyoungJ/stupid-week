- Dad, have you been eating healthy?
- Well, I think so. I rarely skip meals.
- Experts stress that a good diet in our later years is very important.
- It is said to reduce the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and other health issues.
- As we age, we need less energy.
- Then I don't need to eat as much, right?
- That's true. But you still need just as many of the nutrients in food.

- What should I eat, then?
- First, avoid food and drinks like chips, cookies, and soda, which have few nutrients.
- I can do that, I think.
- And for your heart, try to eat enough berries.
- Like grapes, blueberries, and raspberries?
- Yes. And you may need more vitamin D and calcium for bone health, too.
- Wow, there's so much I still need to eat!

- (Nick's daughter is looking in the fridge.) There's not much food in the fridge, Dad.
- I don't want to eat that much these days. You know that I', not as active as I used to be.
- But you still need a balanced diet.
- Don't worry. I eat enough vegetables, tofu, eggs, meat and so on.
- Oh, are you throwing away this orange juice?
- Yes. I was surprised to see what was in it on the label. It has so much sugar in it.

- Let's make room for John for a meal.
- Who is John?
- He's the new employee in our department.
- There's only one new employee this time. The fewest people have been hired.
- That's right. That's why we have to take care of him, so he can adjust well.
- I don't think it's necessary.
- Wouldn't it be nice for him to have dinner with our team?
- That's a good idea.
- Speaking of which, how about this week?
- That's not possible. I've got to work overtime all week.

- Have you seen the movie that was released recently?
- It was really sad. I cried when I watched it.
- Was it sad enough to cry? What's it about?
- It was a movie that reminded me of the meaning of a family.
- A movie about families must be touching.
- I think it'll suit your taste, too.
- Then I'll have to watch it.
- I really like touching movies, too.
- I've watched it more than once, and I've cried every time.
- Well, I'll tell you after I watch it.

- I don't think I'll be able to work at the company that I want.
- The result hasn't even come out! Don't be discouraged.
- But the competition is too intense. I don't think there's a chance.
- I see. Then it's not wrong to be prepared for the next.
- There's always a chance.
- You're right. I agree with you.
- You'll end up going where you want to be. Cheer up!
- Thank you. You always give me positive energy.
