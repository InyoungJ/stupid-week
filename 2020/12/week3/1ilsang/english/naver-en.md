- The plumber you sent to me worked wonders. Now I feel like I have a new sink. Thanks.
- Good to hear that.
- Is there anything I can do for you in return?
- No. Will you accompany me to the dakgalbi restaurant instead? That's not something I can eat alone.
- Are you kidding? Let's go. That's my all-time favorite.

- With or without?
- I think without.
- What about this one? Better with or without?
- I think this time it's better with.
- Alright. Then I'll put this one in. This is going to blur your vision a little bit. Please look up and tell me what you can read.

- Hey, Arman. Good morning. We're both late this morning.
- Yeah. It looks like it.
- How come you're late? You're rarely late for work, right?
- My car broke down on Jayuro. So, I had to call the insurance company and get it towed.
- How many kilometers does your car have on it?
- About 120,000, I guess?

- My co-worker asked me for advice, and I don't know if it helped. What was the problem?
- There was a problem with his boss.
- It must have been a difficult question for you to give him advice on.
- I didn't take anyone's side and told him as straight as I could from a third party's point of view.
- I think you gave him good advice.
- I meant well, but I think it was a little too straightforward.
- Maybe heâ€™s a little hurt, but he also needed that advice

- Did you work this weekend?
- No, I didn't go to work because the project was finished.
- Oh! So you're not even working overtime?
- Yeah. I'm getting off work on time these days.
- Really? You rarely got off work on time before.
- I did. But now that's an old story.
- It couldn't be better these days!
- That's great! Take this opportunity to learn the dances you wanted to learn!
- Sure. I've already registered!

- Mom, it's only five o'clock, and I'm hungry.
- Okay, then I'll prepare for an early dinner.
- I'd like to ask for a steak mixed with fried vegetables.
- Well. Not today.
- That dish isn't ready for being served tight after you order.
- I really want to have a steak, but I'll have it in my dreams.
- Then I'll buy the ingredients and cook you a steak on Friday, okay?
- Thank you! I'll help you!
- Good. Then go and do your homework now.
