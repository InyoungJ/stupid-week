- Yoon, welcome back after a long business trip!
- Thanks. It's good to be back.
- I made the most of my business trip this time.
- I hope your trip was a fruitful one.
- Let's have dinner sometime this week.
- Maybe tomorrow? How does that sound?
- Sure. I'd love to hear your stories.

- I've got a bunch of things to take care of after my trip.
- Are we still on for dinner tonight?
- Arman, could I possibly take a rain check?
- I'm swamped with work this week.
- But you still need to eat anyway.
- I think I should order in some food.
- I got it. Don't work too hard, Yoon.

- Oh, no... I can't focus on my work anymore.
- You look exhausted.
- What are you working on?
- Sorting out some documents. It takes forever.
- Just take a breather.
- I think I can do that job for you today.
- Really? I appreciate that.

- I was lucky today.
- What luck did you have?
- There was a raffle event at the Macaroon store where I happened to stop by, and I won.
- Wow! That's amazing. Did you get a prize?
- Yes! I got a voucher for macaroons.
- Wow! That's worth boasting about! It must have been a newly opened store.
- I think so. They are promoting it very hard.
- There's no better promotion than to have us try it for ourselves.
- That's right. I tried it, and it was delicious, so I recommended it to people I know.
- Yeah. Let's go together next time. I like macaroons too.

- How are you?
- I have been getting by.
- You've been getting by? Did something bad happen?
- I was in the hospital for a while because of a traffic accident.
- Oh, my God! Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want to burden you.
- You should have told me about it.
- I would have visited you at least if I had known.
- Thank you for your concern.

- Let's start the interview.
- How do you make a living after you retired?
- I broadcast on the internet.
- Wow! What sort of content are you broadcasting?
- Reading contents.
- Have you had any difficulties?
- It was hard to work on editing videos and to learn various things.
- You're so great because most people find it hard to make a living after retirement.
- It hasn't been that difficult.
