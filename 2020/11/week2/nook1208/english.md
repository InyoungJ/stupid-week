Hi wellcome home! 

Oh well, look at you

What are you think ?

It's great. I'm wearing the same thing underneath. 

Hey! How come your door's locked

just a second

No! Joey can't know that i'm here.

Why not?

Beacause i didn't know how to tell him that i couldn't go the Knick's game. So i just told him that i had to stay in Tulsa.

So you lied to him?

It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.
Except with you.

Hey open the door! What's going on ?

Why are you dressed like that?

Because chandler's gonna be home in a couple of days so i thought i would just practice the art of seduction. 

i thought i heard a man's voice before.

No i was just doing Chandler's side of conversation you know like "hi how do i look?" "really sexy could i be any more turned on?"

But why are there two glass of wine out?

Because one of them is for you! cheer! Okay, bye bye.

you know, it's funny. I've been practicing the art of seduction myself. 

I think you wanna keep practicing. 

It's joey.

What?

Hey joe!

Dude come home.

What? Why?

Come home.

Look i can't go home. What's going on ?

I don't know how to tell you this.. i think monika is cheeting on you!
I told you that you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
If you can't come home and deal with this, i'm gonna.

No!

i heard him!

Can you hear him now?

No. Okay i'm going in.

No wait!

I heard him again!

Okay i'll go to the home

Okay great! I'll see you when you get hear.
I''ll wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out

Is that really necesarry ?

of course! You'd do it for me. Not that you'd ever have to because i know how to make my woman satisfied. 

Wow that doesn't take long. You said that Tulsa takes a three-hour flight. 

You are forgetting about the time differences.

Chandler! You're home !

That's right your husband is home. So the sex can stop. 

What are you talking about?

Joey said that you are with another man.

How dare you accuse me of that ? 

So then maybe you won't mind if me and my friend look around here

What's he doing?

I arranged some pillows on the bed to like a man

Bedroom's clear although you might need some new pillows.

Okay i'll check the guest room

Why i smell men's colonge?

I think that's you.

oh yeah I rubbed a magazine on myself earilier.

There is nobody here joe.

I guess not

I can't believe that you thought i was cheeting

You owe me an apology.

You're right i'm so sorry monica.

That's an honest mistake. It can happen to anybody. Okay see ya.

Wait a minute , wait a minute.

If you've just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?

I climb down the fire escape, and you can't put that in the closet ?
