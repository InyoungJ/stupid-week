- Oh, it takes longer than I thought.
- Arman, is there anything I can help you with?

- Arman, can we have dinner tonight?
- Tonight? Yes. That sounds nice.
- I'd like to treat you to a meal at a nice restaurant.
- You filled in for me while I was away, so...
- Come on. You also worked hard out there.
- You went to Paris for work.
- True. But still I feel grateful for you helping me out.

- Now I need to turn on Wi-Fi.
- Wait. Where's my phone gone?
- Oh, no! Did I leave my phone on the plane?
- Sorry, but you can't go back on the plane.

- Can I get it back?

- Did you finish last week's assignment?
- Yes, of course.
- I'm still working on my homework. Can you help me?
- I thought it would be easy, but the assignment is too difficult.
- I'm sorry, but I'm busy with my next assignment.
- Are you really going to do this?
- If I were you, I would have done the assignment in advance.
- Do you fell better for saying that?
- I was just giving you some honest advice.
- Sure. It is what it is. I'll try to do my best.

- Hi! You're early.
- Oh! I thought you'd sleep in.
- My alarm didn't go off at all, but I still got up early.
- Isn't the clock broken?
- Right, it is really broken this time.
- Try using your cell phone alarm. It'll be a lot more convenient.
- Cell phone alarms are useless. I'm a heavy sleeper.
- I know that well.

- I think I will gain more weight thanks to having such a delicious meal.
- I'm glad you enjoyed your meal.
- What kind of food do you like in particular?
- I'm not really a picky eater, but I especially like noodles.
- I see. I'll treat you to some Thai noodles next time.
