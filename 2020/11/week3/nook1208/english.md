A lot of people are thankful for those

Hello? Rachel?

Who is it?

It's your favorite sister.

Hide my rings

Hi amy.

Do you have a hair straightener?

Hi!

Hi~ hair straightener.

i haven't seen you in like a year.

oh i know i know i've just been crazed.

oh me too. I had a baby.

I decorated dad's office

Oh yeah? Unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, not the same thing. 

listen, about the hair straightener. Honey i really need one. I'm gonna have dinner at my boyfriend's house. is this emmet?

It's emma

It's a girl?

Hi amy

amy do you remember ross?

Not really. Buy you are much cuter than that geeky guy she used to date.

That was me.

No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her, since like the ninth grade

Still me

No i'm not talking about you, come on!
It was your fat friends's brother with that bad afro, remember?

Okay Amy, i'm gonna save you some time okay?. All me!

Oh she's precious. 

Do you ever worry that she's gonna get your real nose?

Amy, yes i do, i really do.

Hello? yeah hang on, one second 
Can i take this upstairs?

Sure we won't live there but..

seriously? it's just these rooms?
I thought you were a doctor.

Yeah no, ross have a PhD.

Ewwww!

god she is unbelievable!

i know. I mean a phd is just as good as.an MD.

Yeah oh sure ross yeah. If i have a heart attack at a restaurant, i want you there with your fossil brush.

Stupid thanksgiving !

What, what happened?

My boyfriends cancelled on me! i mean I thought i finally find a real relationship, someone that i can spend this day with. and then his wife comes back into the town. 
I swear, It's almost not even worth dating married guy. 

Don't say that

i was really looking forward to this.
It was gonna be such a beautiful thanksgiving.
we were gonna have sushi !

Don't cry amy

Ross could i talk to you in private?

Sure, you wanna go upstairs?

Look i was thinking, if it's okay with monica, i would like to invite amy to thanksgiving.

That's great idea. it'll be like pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis.

i know she's a little tough to take.
But she is my sister and she has nowhere else to go. And she's emma's aunt. I'd like them to bond

Ok, fine but I don't want them bonding too much.
I don't want her telling emma she needs a nose job.

Well Ross you know what? She may need one.
We are just gonna have to make our peace with that.
