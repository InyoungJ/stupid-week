# Amy, Rachel's other sister part 3/3, fight sisters

In case you hadn't notice, i'm not talking to you. 

this is just classic rachel.

Oh yeah? Do you remember in high school when i died, and didn't give you my baby?

this might be my one chance to have a child. I mean you know that i have been so busy focussing my career.

What l? What career.

I'm a decorator?

You decorate dad's office and now you're a decorator? Ok! I went to the zoo yesterday, so now i'm a koalar bear.

Why can't you ever be supportive?

you wanna talk 'supportive?'
You didn't come and visited me when i was in the hospital having the baby.

oh yeah? You didn't come to see me in the hospital when i was getting my lips done.

I did the first time.
Do you know why i'm not giving emily to you?

Emma

Oh whose side are you on. 
I'm not giving you emma because there is no way, you could  handle the responsibility of a child.

How hard could it be? you do it.

Do i know why you don't want me to have the baby? 
Because you don't want me to be happy.
You have always jealous of me.

Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsibility?
Your immaturity? Your total disregard from other people's feelings?

To name a few ! You've always been like this. 
You had to have everything and i couldn't have anything.
Like in junior high. When you stole timmy from me, do you even realize how much that hurt me?

Timmy was my boyfriend.
And you made out with him!

Oh come on, it was twenty years ago. Just get over it.

Oh i cannot believe.. i cannot believe that i invited you here today!

Do you know what i cannot believe? 
That's my so called syster get 30% discount from Ralph lauren. But i have to pay retail?

It's 45.

You bitch. You think you're perfect with your baby and your small apartment.
Let me tell you something, your baby? Isn't even that cute. 

Too far amy too far

You Take that back

No!

Take it back!

No! What are you gonna do? Make me?

Hey man i work out.

So do i

i do pilates

I do yoga

Bring it on!

Put the plates back in the boxes!
 
Did you just push me?

Yeah, I think i did

Alright that's it!

Forget the bubble wrap there isn't time!

Shouldn't we stop this?

What are you? Out of your mind? Let's toss some Jell-O on them!

All right! That is it!

This is our apartment and you cannot behave this way! And if you can't act your age, you shouldn't be here at all!
Those plates may not as nice as the pretty pink one that i picked out! But they're very important to monica.
So i want you to apology to her right now.

I'm sorry

I'm so sorry mon.

All right that's better. Now i want you to apology to each other and mean it.

Sorry

By the way that fight was totally arousing.

Dude well done! You know what? If i die and rachel dies and monica dies then you can totally take care of emma.

Oh yeah? well, Thanks

So now do i get joey?

Ok but you should know
He eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose
