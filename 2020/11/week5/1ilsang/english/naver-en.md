- Wow, it was only 18 minutes from Avignon on the train.
- Now let's enjoy Van Gogh's city.
- He produced hundreds of paintings and drawings in Arles.
- Look! There are plaques on the street all over the place.
- They tell us where the Van Gogh sites are.
- first, shall se do a nice little walk through the Arles Amphitheater?
- Okay. Be careful of uneven sidewalks.

- Dad, I'm sorry that I haven't come to see you for a while.
- It's all good. I know you're always busy.
- I've been meaning to visit you, but I couldn't find the time.
- Don't worry. I've been doing quite well.
- I brought this hair dye for you.
- Oh, thank you. I was about to get a new one.
- Perfect timing!

- You said that the hair dye you used was too strong.
- Yes. After I dyed my hair, my head felt itchy.
- That's why I got this one.
- All the ingredients in this product are natural.
- Thanks, dear. You shouldn't have.
- First, test this product on just part of your hair.
- Okay, I will.

- Since my cellphone has completely stopped working, I can't send and receive messages.
- I guess you should buy a new smartphone.
- The new devices are faster and easier to use these days.
- I've had it with this piece of junk. It's so annoying!
- Fair enough. You've been using it for over five years.
- But the only downside of the new ones is that they're expensive.
- It's reasonable to pay for it rather than be stressed out.
- You're right.

- Bill is always the same.
- What do you mean?
- Bill teased his friends yesterday about their grades.
- He always thinks it's fun to tease people.
- That's right. Ever since he was a kid, I don't think he knows it's wrong.
- Then I'll have to tell him it's wrong.
- That way, he won't make fun of his friends again.
- That's a good idea, but I'm not sure if he'll show up for school today.
- He has his own way of life.

- Can I borrow some money before payday?
- I'm not sure because recently, many people borrowed some money from me but haven't paid me back.
- Hey, what are friends for?
- That's not the problem. It's difficult with my finances.
- Three people haven't paid me back yet.
- Okay, let's see what happens.
- It's a big deal if you say no.
- You need to make a budget.
- I'd really love to do that, but it's not easy.
- You won't have to be in debt anymore if you spend with a plan.
