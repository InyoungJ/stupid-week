- Wow, did you ride the Super Viking?
- Of course! But I was little disappointed. It was fun, but it wasn't that scary.
- Really? I heard it's the scariest ride in the amusement part.
- Me too. But it was pretty good.
- That's a relief. Anyway, aren't you hungry?
- We've been on rides for three hours with no break.
- Yes, I think I'm going to starve to death.
- I've only had a sandwich so far.
- Then what would you like for dinner?
- How about the restaurant we went to last month?

- Whey don't you go to the furniture store with me?
- Furniture store? What's that place?
- It's a place where you can buy furniture cheaply because there are many different brands of furniture.
- I see. But why are you buying furniture?
- My roommate's bed is broken, and he needs to buy a new one.
- Is it okay for you to pick out the bed he's going to use?
- He has too many thoughts and is indecisive.
- However, think in his shoes. It could be unpleasant.
- I think you're right. I'll let him choose it for himself.
