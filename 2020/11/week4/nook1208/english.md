# Amy, Rachel's other sister part 2/3, If all die

Hi!

Hey!

Hey you guys. this is my sister amy.
Amy this is chandler, joey, phoebe, you know mon.

Oh my god, you're on Day's our of lives?

Yeah

Wow.. they must put a lot of makeup on you.

Happy thanksgiving

So, welcome ! is this the first time you're seeing emma ?

Yeah, I think so. It's nice to meet you, emma

Phoebe.

oh~ that's a funny noise.

hey, where is the baby?

I just put her down for a nap

Listen I was just thinking. you know what'd be incredible?
If you guys die !

thank you amy

no, no,  then i would get the baby.
you know, it would be just like a movie.
like at first i wouldn't know what to do with her then i would rise to the accasions,
then i get a make-over then i get married.

That's a great movie !

Now listen, Not that you can stop me or anything cause you know,  you'd be dead.
But i was thinking changing her name. I'm just not really a big fan of emily

emma

Emma, ross wants you.

Pheobe!

Why does she keep making that noise?

Amy, I don't know how to tell you this but, 
if something were to happen to ross or myself,
You wouldn't get the baby. 

what? but.. who would ?

We haven't officially asked them yet, We would want Monica and chandler.

I can't belive you want us to raise emma!

Yeah, I'm so moved

I can't believe this.  hold on a second, If you guys die, I don't get your baby?

Amy, see,  we're a lot closer Monica and Chandler. We see them everyday.
And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.

Connected to what? She is a lump?

You know guys, i've got to say, this means so much to me.
I mean that you would trust me with your child.
we all know that Monica and I have been trying to get the baby of our own. 
And I've had my doubts about my skills as a father but that you two, you two..

This guy ? seriously ? 

No, you're all about the fun.

Look, I may not know a lot about the babies.
But you really think i'm not capable?

No, you both are equally capable. 
I mean, you're strongest when you're together

Okay so if we both have emma and i die, then monica would have to give her up?

Yes she'd have to give her up.

I lie better than that, right?

So let me get this straight. So my friends die, we get the baby and then my wife dies then Emma, the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?

There's your movie!

There you are. You disappeared after dinner.

Oh did somebody miss me?
is there a child to raise poorly?

Ross and Rachel didn't know what they were talking about. 
Not that they are so responsible. Emma is the product of a bottle of Merlot and a five years old condom.

You know? But they are right. I'm a strong father-figure and I never will be.

No, you learn these things. You grow into it.

Yeah but it's not who i am. Everything they said is exactly why i was worried about having a baby.
And it's true. everybody knows it.

I don't know ! I want to have a baby with you because you're going to be an amazing dad.
At the fun parts and at the hard parts

Oh, can you picture me saying,  "Go to your room! you're grounded!"

Can you hear me say you're grounded?

You said that to me last week.

How hard is it? 
No shoes on the furniture !
