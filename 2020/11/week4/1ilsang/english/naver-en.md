- It's fantastic to take in all the nature out here.
- People told me there are some cute cities, such as "the city of rocks."
- Right. Every town in Provence we see is a gem.
- Next time come in June or July, and you can enjoy the lavender fields.
- But everything, including accommodation, is pricey around then.
- Thanks for the information.
- How about we go to Arles tomorrow? The city of Van Gogh.

- Is there any change on your mind lately?
- Why? Do you think so?
- You have suddenly cut your hair incredibly short!

- Is that so? I don't remember that at all.
- Oh my! Aren't you too indifferent to me?
- I knew you had cut your hair, but I didn't know it was at this time of year.
- You need to believe that I'm not indifferent to you.
- Okay. Anyway, thanks for your concern.
