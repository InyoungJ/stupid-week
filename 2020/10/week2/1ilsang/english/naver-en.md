- Dad, shall we go out for a walk?
- Sure. Summer's ending and it's a beautiful day for a walk.
- Watch out! That dog is running right at us!
- Don't worry. That dog is on a leash.
- Is it? Oh, you're right...
- They have to pay a fine if their dog is not on a leash.
- That sounds reasonable.
- Some dogs are aggressive and can hurt others, right?

- How about adopting a dog, Dad?
- With a dog, you'll feel less lonely, and you'll get to go on more walks.
- Hmm... that sounds tempting.
- Do you remember our dog?
- Of course I do. I miss him a lot.
- If you're interested, let me look for a good one for you.
- I'm volunteering at a dog shelter, so...
- Alright. If I make up my mind, I'll let you know.

- Dad, why don't you wear sunscreen?
- Well, I do use a little bit of sunscreen in the summertime.
- Experts say that we have to protect our skin all year round.
- I'm old already, so why should I try to protect my skin?
- Time goes by faster and faster as I age.
- Come on, Dad. You don't look a day over 60.
- Some people your age wear sunscreen even at home.
- I got it. Thanks, dear.

- Let's talk frankly.
- Okay. What's up? Tell me.
- Don't you think we headed in the wrong direction?
- Well, as a matter of fact, I think so, too.
- We have some serious problems to take care of on this project.
- I understand, but I'm not sure where to start.
- I'm not sure either.
- Then, why not bring in some more engineers with lots of experience?
- That's a great idea.

- You've gained 10 kilograms in a month! What happened to you?
- I guess it's because I've been sitting at my desk for the exams.
- It would be good for you to exercise if you get a chance.
- I don't have time until all the exams are over.
- Well, you're on vacation, so you could take more rest and do some exercise.
- I will.
- But I still have three exams left to go.
- Then focus on the tests first, and after that you will be able to exercise.
- Great. I'll go register at the gym as soon as the exams are over.
- That's good idea.

- Don't forget to pay for the internet this month.
- What are you talking about? You already paid for it!
- You've got to be kidding. I don't recall paying for it.
- You said you paid for it a few days ago. Don't be so forgetful!
- Oh, I remember now. I must be getting old.
- Thank you. If it weren't for you, I would have paid it twice.
- It's not the problem that you almost paid twice! I think you forget things a lot lately.
- Yes, I think so too.
- Why don't you solve the problem before it gets worse?
- Sure, I'll go to the hospital and find out the cause.
