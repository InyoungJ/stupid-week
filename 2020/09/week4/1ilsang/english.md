- Are you in line?

- What brings you to Granada?
- A Korean drama that aired several months ago.
- Many scenes in that drama where filmed here so I was curious about the city.
- I'm a huge fan of Korean dramas.
- Really? When you watch them, are they dubbed or do they have subtitles?
- They have subtitles in English.
- The Korean language sounds so unique.
- I'd love to learn Korean someday.

- Would you like to go to a nursing home this weekend?
- Why do you want to go to a nursing home all of a sudden?
- I've been volunteering for a while.
- You're doing a great job.
- In fact, I'm not married, so I'm going to be an elderly person living alone someday.
- I hope you will find yourself a good spouse soon.
- Well, maybe someday... Anyway, let's go volunteer our service together this weekend.
- That's great. I think elderly people will be very happy to see you.

- I go to a bookstore and spend almost all my free time there these days.
- Really? You must love books.
- Well, bookstores are not just selling books like before.
- It almost switched to the concept of cafes and places to relax.
- Really? I didn't know since I haven't been to a bookstore for a while.
- Bookstores are turning into a cultural space.
- I should go to the newly opened bookstore.
- Good, I heard that the new bookstore near your house also has a cafe where you can grab a bite.
- Wow, times have changed a log.

## 0926

- Excuse me, Professor, I think I got a wrong grade.
- Really? What's wrong?
- I was expecting an A, but I got a B.
- Okay, let's see why you didn't get such good grades.
- Hmm, you've been absent twice.
- Oh, yes. I thought it would be all right because I gave you my absence report.
- However, I should evaluate your grade objectively.
- Professor, is there any way I can raise my grades?
- I'm sorry. I can't correct your grades for the sake of equity with other students.
- Pay more attention to attendance next semester.

- You're a natural.
- You're very sweet.
